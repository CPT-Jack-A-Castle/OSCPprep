# Taking and Modifying Public Exploits 

[NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing) 
[Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) 

## Pre-requisites for runninging exploits

- Check the version of the operating system.
- Check the software version.
- Check if there is exploit for it (Searchsploit, ExploitDB, Google, etc).
- If you have an exploit, is there a Metasploit Module for it?

## Installing searchsploit (Already in Kali)

- apt update && apt install exploitdb

## Install binsploits
Note: bin-sploits contains a set of compiled binaries that are tied to exploits in the exploitdb database. Installing this package will take some time depending on your network connection. 

    apt update && apt install exploitdb-bin-sploits

## updating searchsploit

    searchsploit -u

## Basic Searching: 

    searchsploit <program> <Operating System> <programming language> <version #> etc
    searchsploit -t php windows

## Exclude unwanted results
    
    searchsploit linux kernel 5.2 --exclude="Poc"

## View exploits from Searchsploit
    
    searchsploit 9542 --examine
    searchsploit -x window/remote/42031.py


## Copy exploit to current working directory
    
    searchsploit -m <Exploit Title> <Path>

## Access Exploits from Exploit-DB website: 

    searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4 -w

## Run an nmap scan result through searchsploit: 
1. Nmap -Pn 172.21.0.0 -oX results.xml
2. searchsploit -x --nmap results.xml

## Exploit not working
run tcpdump and view traffic
run Wireshark and view traffic
Is there a firewall? - try ports you know the box is allowing traffic out of (ie. exploit port 8080, catch shell on 139)
